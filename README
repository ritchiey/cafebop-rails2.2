== Setup

The following config environment variables must be set for this application to run:

APPLICATION_DOMAIN
GOOGLE_API_KEY
COUNTRY_CODE
INSTANCE_NAME
                        
For S3 services:
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

For PayPal (production only. Test environments will default to some hardcoded sandbox values):  
PAYPAL_LOGIN
PAYPAL_PASSWORD
PAYPAL_SIGNATURE
PAYPAL_APP_ID

   
Create a new rake task in deploy.rake that will respond to "rake deploy:init:your-environment"
to setup the environment variables for your new environment.

See here: http://docs.heroku.com/config-vars for more info on how to set these on Heroku.

Additionally, an S3 bucket must be created for each environment to store uploaded
image files. Run the create_buckets.rb (once only) to create these. Note: This only
needs to be done once and there's a good chance that someone has already done it.
