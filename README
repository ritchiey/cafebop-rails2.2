== Setup

The following config environment variables must be set for this application to run:
                        
For S3 services:
AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

See here: http://docs.heroku.com/config-vars for how to set these on Heroku.

Additionally, an S3 bucket must be created for each environment to store uploaded
image files. Run the create_buckets.rb (once only) to create these. Note: This only
needs to be done once and there's a good chance that someone has already done it.
