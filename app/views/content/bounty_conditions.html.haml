  %li You must provide us with a valid Paypal account id capable of receiving funds.
  %li You can add as many shops as you like but they must be real ones (imaginary shops don't pay).
  %li You must have the details right (Name, Phone Number, Opening Hours, Cuisine)
  %li You warrant that you have obtained the list of shops from a legal and legitimate source. If you happen to have collected a list of such details somehow, that's great but data-mining is unacceptable.
