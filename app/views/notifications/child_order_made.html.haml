  Your order for #{@order.shop} is ready. In fact, #{h @order.parent.user} is probably
  picking it up right now.
  
  You should receive:

\-------------------------------------------------------
-@order.order_items.each do |i|
  ="#{i.quantity} x #{h i.description} @#{number_to_currency i.price}"
\-------------------------------------------------------
:plain
  You will owe #{h @order.parent.user} #{number_to_currency @order.total}.
